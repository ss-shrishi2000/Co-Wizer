<h1> COVID-19  DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING AND CNN WITH DATA ANALYSIS, OUTBREAK PREDICTION AND VISUALISATION. </h1>


 <h3> Features Implemented </h3>

 GOAL OF THE PROJECT :- Successful detection of Covid-19 using Chest X-Rays by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and visualising the world data using Covid-19 Trends.

For chest X-Ray dcm, jpg, or png are preferred. Not only X-Rays but CT-Scans can also be used as a dataset for the project.

<h2> AIM AND GOALS :-  </h2>

 <h3> PART-1 (SARS-COV-2 DETECTION)=>  </h3>

<ul>
<li> Blood tests are costly (not affordable by all sections of the society). </li>
<li> Blood tests take time to conduct (approx 5 to 6 hours per patient). </li>
<li> Extent of The Spread In the Body Can be detected using Deep Learning Models And CNN. </li>
<li> Classify using Image Classification Models And Segmentation Techniques and prediction of COVID Positive or Negative Verdict. </li>
</ul>


<h3> PART-2 (DATA TRENDS ANALYSIS)=> </h3>
<ul>
Visualising the preprocessed data set under the following heads :-
<li> WorldWide COVID-19 Cases. </li>
<li> Cases Density Animation On World Map Along With Time Lapses. </li>
<li> Cases over the Time With Area Plot. </li>
<li> Using Folium Maps for presenting Confirmed, Active, Recovered, Death, New Cases, Population, Cases/Million with Choropleth Maps. </li>
<li> Deaths And Recoveries Per 100 Cases. </li>
<li> Top 15-20 Countries Data Analysis, Scatter Plots, Line Plots, Pyplots, Bar Plots, Tree Map Analysis And Growth Rates  (
 x days from 100+ cases, 
x days from 1000+ cases, 
x days from 100,000+ cases
). </li>
<li> Confirmed Cases Country And Day-Wise Visualisation. </li>
<li> COVID-19 Pandemic Comparison With Other Similar Epidemics (SARS, EBOLA, MERS, H1N1). </li>
 </ul>

 <h3> NOTE :- All of the plots and visualisations are completely interactive and customised (Zoom-In, Zoom-Out, 
 Transcend, etc, Features shall be made available).  </h3>

 <h2> PART-3 => (COVID-19 SPREAD AND OUTBREAK ANALYSIS IN INDIA USING MACHINE LEARNING). </h2>
 
<li> Reading files by creating dataframes using Pandas. </li>
<li> Using Coordinates of Indian States And Union-Territories and grouping day by day data of countries like India, Italy, Korea, and Wuhan, etc. </li>
<li> Progression Of the Cases in our country India as compared to other countries. </li>
<li> Visualisation Inference amongst the various states such as => (Kerala crossing Maharashtra in terms of highest 
number of confirmed cases, Haryana and telangana having highest count of confirmed Foreign National Count, top 3 states with maximum number of confirmed cases). </li>
<li> Affected States/Union Territories in a short time span thereby, extending it to a larger dataset. </li>
<li> Visualise the spread in our country graphically for analysing the present condition. </li>
<li> How are the CoronaVirus cases rising? (Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Parabolic, etc). </li>

<br>
<br>


<h2> PART-4 => (IF TIME PERSISTS) </h2>
<li> Connecting the Deep Learning Model to A Web-Based Application wherein the user shall be able to make choices which data to be rendered or visualised on the screen. </li>
<li> Deploying Tech Stack => Heroku Or Netlify. </li>
<ul> 
Technologies Or Tools To Be Used :- 
<li> ReactJS(Maybe for enhanced GUI) </li>
<li> HTML </li>
<li> CSS </li>
<li> Github, etc. </li>
</ul>
